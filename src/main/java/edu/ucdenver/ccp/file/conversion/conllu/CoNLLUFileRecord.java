/**
 * This data structure is designed to hold records from files using the CoNLL-U
 * format as described here: https://universaldependencies.org/format.html This
 * code was written specifically for extracting dependency parse information so
 * it may be incomplete in regards to some of the other columns.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Sentences consist of one or more word lines, and word lines contain the following fields:
 * 
 * ID: Word index, integer starting at 1 for each new sentence; may be a range for multiword tokens; may be a decimal number for empty nodes (decimal numbers can be lower than 1 but must be greater than 0).
 * FORM: Word form or punctuation symbol.
 * LEMMA: Lemma or stem of word form.
 * UPOS: Universal part-of-speech tag.
 * XPOS: Language-specific part-of-speech tag; underscore if not available.
 * FEATS: List of morphological features from the universal feature inventory or from a defined language-specific extension; underscore if not available.
 * HEAD: Head of the current word, which is either a value of ID or zero (0).
 * DEPREL: Universal dependency relation to the HEAD (root iff HEAD = 0) or a defined language-specific subtype of one.
 * DEPS: Enhanced dependency graph in the form of a list of head-deprel pairs.
 * MISC: Any other annotation.
 * The fields DEPS and MISC replace the obsolete fields PHEAD and PDEPREL of the CoNLL-X format. In addition, we have modified the usage of the ID, FORM, LEMMA, XPOS, FEATS and HEAD fields as explained below.
 * 
 * The fields must additionally meet the following constraints:
 * 
 * Fields must not be empty.
 * Fields other than FORM and LEMMA must not contain space characters.
 * Underscore (_) is used to denote unspecified values in all fields except ID. Note that no format-level distinction is made for the rare cases where the FORM or LEMMA is the literal underscore â€“ processing in such cases is application-dependent. Further, in UD treebanks the UPOS, HEAD, and DEPREL columns are not allowed to be left unspecified.
