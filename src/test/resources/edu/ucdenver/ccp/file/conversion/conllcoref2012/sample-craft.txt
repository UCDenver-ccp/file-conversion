Intraocular pressure in genetically distinct mice: an update and strain survey

Abstract

Background

Little is known about genetic factors affecting intraocular pressure (IOP) in mice and other mammals. The purpose of this study was to determine the IOPs of genetically distinct mouse strains, assess the effects of factors such as age, sex and time of day on IOP in specific strain backgrounds, and to assess the effects of specific candidate gene mutations on IOP.

Results

Based on over 30 studied mouse strains, average IOP ranges from approximately 10 to 20 mmHg.
